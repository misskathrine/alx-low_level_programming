# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

0x0A. C-argc, argv project

argv - argument vector: a variable that contains the arguemnts passed
       to a program through the command line.

	- A vector is a one-dimensional array, an argv is a one-
	  dimensional array of strings

argc - argument count: number of arguments passed to a program.
	(including the program)

The project was about writing programs that arguments could be passed to on the command line while running them. The project revealed the prototypes of main() and learnt how to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
